# Income Prediction

This code is for demonstration purposes. We use a well-known dataset as a simple example of categorical and numerical features used to predict a binary classification.

The raw data is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository's [Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult).
